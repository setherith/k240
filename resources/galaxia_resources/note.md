# Galaxia

Galaxia is another game I started to develop a long time ago, with a goal of reinventing and improving on K240.

It lives [here](https://github.com/setherith/Galaxia), but is very dead now!

By combining the resources from Galaxia with the K240 repo, I hope to speed up development and create a better game.

I want to keep the K240 experience as close to original, but I might add some of the concepts to the baseline as options.
